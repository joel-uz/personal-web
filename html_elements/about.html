    <h1>ABOUT MYSELF:</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>I grew up in a small town in Kerala, India. <br>
      And yea, this is me ;)</p>

    <br>
    <p>At the age of 18, I started to have a lot of interest in doing small python projects. During my higher
    secondary studies, my friends and myself created a small marketplace to sell goods which was a basic one.
    But it was this start that led me here today. Later I had an interest in learning app development and I've learnt
    Flutter with dart programming from a UDEMY course of Angela Yu.  </p>
    <br><br>

    <p>I really love to make things which is going on in my mind and love to experiment things how its gonna look like.
    That's why photographyis my pasion. Love it 3000.</p>
